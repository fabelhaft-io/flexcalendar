# `server/api/` — API service

The thin REST facade that the project's own clients use. Stock apps bypass it
and hit CalDAV directly (CLAUDE.md).

- **Owning epic:** [E05 — API core](../../docs/epics/E05-api-core.md).
- **What belongs here:** the Node 24 LTS + TypeScript service on **Fastify**
  (D-01, `docs/02-technology-choices.md`), and the only place recurrence is
  expanded — with **`ical.js`**, never hand-rolled (ADR 0002, INV-05). It
  reaches CalDAV as the user through the HMAC-signed delegated principal of
  D-05 and validates Zitadel JWTs against JWKS (D-03).
- **Related epics:** [E07](../../docs/epics/E07-change-fanout.md) adds the push
  fan-out worker (data-only change pings, INV-06);
  [E06](../../docs/epics/E06-sharing-feeds-onboarding.md) adds sharing, feeds
  and onboarding; [E13](../../docs/epics/E13-private-mode.md) adds the Private
  write path. It stores raw iCalendar objects and envelope ciphertext only, and
  never decrypts (INV-01, INV-07).
- **Not here:** CalDAV storage (that is `../caldav/`) and any client code.
